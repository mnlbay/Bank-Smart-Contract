# Bank Smart Contract

## Description
The Bank Smart Contract is a Solidity-based Ethereum smart contract that provides basic banking functionalities. It allows users to deposit Ether (ETH) into their accounts, withdraw funds, transfer Ether between accounts, and check their account balances. The contract is designed to operate securely and transparently on the Ethereum blockchain, enabling users to interact with their funds in a decentralized manner.

## Features
- **Deposit**: Users can deposit Ether into their accounts.
- **Withdrawal**: Users can withdraw Ether from their accounts.
- **Transfer**: Users can transfer Ether from their accounts to another user's account.
- **Balance Check**: Users can check their account balance.
- **Invariant Check**: The contract includes a function to check the internal consistency of balances to ensure data integrity.
